# Copy Clip

A copy-to-clipboard button that turns your code into a sheet of paper, folds it, and clips it to a wooden clipboard.

Click **Copy** and the snippet lifts off the card, folds in half, flies over and snaps under a steel clip, with sound to match.

**Live demo:** [starknightt.github.io/copy-clip](https://starknightt.github.io/copy-clip/)

Want the hands-free version? Open [`index.html#demo`](https://starknightt.github.io/copy-clip/#demo). A scripted cursor copies twice, the sheets stack, and the clip clears them before the loop restarts. Click once anywhere to turn the sound on.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.** One file, no build step, no framework.
- **Inline SVG and CSS:** the clipboard, the steel clip and the paper texture are all drawn in code.
- **Web Audio API:** every sound is synthesized live. There are no audio files.
- **Clipboard API:** `navigator.clipboard.writeText`, with a hidden-textarea fallback.
- **Google Fonts:** Bricolage Grotesque for the UI and JetBrains Mono for the code.

## Installation

### One-file install

Copy [`index.html`](index.html) into your project. That's it. It has no dependencies and only reaches the network for Google Fonts.

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/StarKnightt/copy-clip.git
cd copy-clip
npx serve .
```

Then open `http://localhost:3000`. Any static server works.

> **Why a server?** Opening the file directly works too, but `navigator.clipboard` needs a secure context. On `file://` the component falls back to the older `execCommand('copy')` path.

## Optional editor

Open [the local editor](http://localhost:3000/?editor=1) after serving the page, or append `?editor=1` to the page URL. Use **Edit text** to update the snippet, or **Advanced → Edit on the card** to type directly. Click the card title to rename it. The preview shows up to eight lines and **Copy** sends the full text.

The editor saves your text, card title and pending edits in the current browser profile when storage is available. Reopen the editor at the same site address to restore them.

In editor mode, **Language** lets you change the display language and syntax highlighting. Automatic mode uses a recognized title extension to resolve the language, with the code as a fallback. Keep `locales.js` and the `vendor` folder alongside the HTML for all options. The vendored Highlight.js 11.12.0 bundle is [BSD 3-Clause](vendor/highlight-LICENSE.txt).

## Windows app

On Windows, install Node.js 22+, the .NET 10 SDK and WebView2 Evergreen, then run `npm install` and `npm start`. For portable builds see the [Windows guide](docs/WINDOWS.md).

## Usage

The component fills its own page and scales to fit, so the easiest way to drop it in is an iframe:

```html
<iframe
  src="/copy-clip/index.html"
  title="Copy to clipboard demo"
  style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 4 / 5; border: 0"
  allow="clipboard-write"
></iframe>
```

To show your own snippet, edit two constants in the `<script>` block:

```js
const CODE = `your code here`;   // the plain text that goes to the clipboard
const HL = [                      // the same code, one highlighted line per entry
  '<span class="k">const</span> x = <span class="n">1</span>;',
];
```

`CODE` is what gets copied. `HL` is what's drawn on the card and the paper. Keep them in sync.

## Options

These are plain constants and CSS variables in `index.html`. There's no config object, so you edit them in place.

| Name | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `#demo` (URL hash) | off | Plays the scripted cursor loop instead of the interactive button. |
| `CODE` | `debounce` snippet | Plain text written to the clipboard. |
| `HL` | `debounce` snippet | Syntax-highlighted lines for the card. Classes: `k` keyword, `f` function, `n` number, `c` comment. |
| `T` | see code | Animation timeline in seconds, relative to the click (`paper`, `lift`, `fold`, `fly`, `slide`, `clipOpen`, `clipClose`, ...). |
| `MASTER` | `3` | Output gain for all sounds. |
| `SLOTS` | 3 slots | Offset and rotation of each stacked sheet. |
| `G.scale` | `.68` | Size of a sheet once it lands on the clipboard. |
| `L` | `8.6` | Length of the `#demo` loop, in seconds. |
| `--ink` | `#23211D` | Button and text color. |
| `--ok` | `#2F6B4F` | Green fill of the **Copied** state. |
| `--card` / `--paper` | `#FBFAF7` / `#FDFBF6` | Card and paper colors. |
| `--kw` `--fn` `--num` `--com` | plum, teal, olive, grey | Syntax colors. |

The clipboard holds at most **3** sheets. A 4th copy slides the oldest one out from under the clip.

## How It Works

1. **Copy.** The real text goes to the system clipboard. The button scales down, fills green and swaps to **Copied** with a check pop.
2. **Paper.** A sheet fades in under the code, so the text sits on paper. A seeded rustle plays.
3. **Lift.** The sheet tilts up slightly and its shadow grows softer and further away.
4. **Fold.** The right half rotates 180° behind the left, so the start of each line stays face-up. A crease and a shade fade in.
5. **Fly.** The folded sheet follows a curved path to the clipboard, shrinking as it goes. A whoosh pans left to right.
6. **Clip.** The steel jaw opens, the sheet slides up under it, and the jaw snaps shut with a small two-step rebound and a metallic click.
7. **Reset.** About 1.5 s later the button eases back to **Copy**.

Every visual and every sound is a pure function of time since the click. One `requestAnimationFrame` loop drives all of it, only `transform` and `opacity` change, and the loop stops when nothing is moving.

## Customization

### Colors

All colors live in `:root` at the top of the `<style>` block:

```css
:root {
  --ink: #1B2430;   /* button + text */
  --ok:  #1F6FEB;   /* "Copied" fill */
  --kw:  #B3261E;   /* keywords */
  --fn:  #0B6E4F;   /* function names */
}
```

The wood and steel colors are in the `.board` gradient and the `#mb` / `#jg` SVG gradients.

### Timing and sound

Slow the whole thing down by stretching the timeline in `T`:

```js
const T = {
  paper: [.02, .20], lift: [.04, .34], fold: [.30, .62],
  fly: [.60, 1.60],      // was [.60, 1.18]: a longer, floatier flight
  slide: [1.60, 1.86],   // shift everything after fly by the same amount
  clipOpen: 1.40, clipClose: 1.88,
  // ...
};
```

Sounds and visuals read the same `T`, so they stay in sync. To make it quieter, lower `MASTER`:

```js
const MASTER = 1.5;   // half as loud
```

Users can also mute it with the speaker button in the top-right corner.

## Accessibility

- **Reduced motion:** with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`, copying is instant. You get the **Copied** state only, with no sheet, no flight and no sound.
- **Keyboard:** the button is a native `<button>`, so **Enter** and **Space** work. It has a visible `:focus-visible` ring.
- **Screen readers:** an `aria-live` region announces "Copied to clipboard". The mute toggle uses `aria-pressed` and updates its label.
- **Decorative parts** (clipboard, clip, sheets, cursor) are `aria-hidden`.

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers:

- Chrome / Edge 90+
- Firefox 90+
- Safari 15+
- Mobile Safari / Chrome on iOS and Android

Sound starts after the first click or keypress, because browsers block audio until the user interacts with the page.
